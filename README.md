# Library
A collection of different functions, classes, and other random things I've made

All code in this library is under the MIT License, meaning that anyone who wants it has basically all freedom to do anything with this code. You can use it in commercial products, distribute derivative works, modified versions, etc. I hope that some of this code can be useful to everyone out there.

If you find any bugs or issues with anything in here, PLEASE post it in the issues. I don't mind constructive criticism either. I want to make this code as functional and optimized as possible.

If you'd like to contribute something to the repository yourself, just put in a Pull request and I'll take a look at it.

Also, if you make anything cool using anything in here, let me know! I'd love to see if anyone is actually able to use this random code for something helpful!
